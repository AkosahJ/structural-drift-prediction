\# Building Drift Prediction – ML Regression Model



This project uses machine learning methods to predict structural drift from building properties, earthquake intensity measures, and duration-related features. A cleaned subset of the NDE1.0 dataset is used to train and evaluate both Linear Regression and Random Forest regression models.
